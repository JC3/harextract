# harextract

Browser-base HAR extraction tool.

All you need is harextract.html -- it's completely self-contained and doesn't require
any online resources.

Open the page in a browser and use the file chooser button on the page to load a HAR
file. 

From there you can save individual files, and also save the entire collection as a ZIP
file:

It is extremely basic right now but may evolve over time.

Note: Currently you'll find that not every file in the HAR is listed. This is because
I made it skip files that don't actually have content, and files with unsupported 
encoding schemes. The GUI for this may be improved some day, or not. 

## Bugs

Probably a ton. Written quickly and only tested on Chrome for Windows. Report them on
the issues page.
